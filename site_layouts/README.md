# Site Layout Placeholders

This directory holds placeholder references for site layout images.

Expected filenames:
- `layout1.jpg`
- `layout2.jpg`
- `layout3.jpg`

Actual layout images are stored externally and should not be committed to the
repository. The application will download needed images at runtime or operate
without them if unavailable.
